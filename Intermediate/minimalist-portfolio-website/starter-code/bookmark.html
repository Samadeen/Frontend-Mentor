  This project required me to build a fully responsive landing page to the designs 
  provided. I used HTML5, along with CSS Grid and JavaScript for the areas that 
  required interactivity, such as the features section.

  Project Background

  This project was a front-end  challenge from Frontend Mentor. It’s a platform that 
  enables you to practice building websites to a design and project brief. Each challenge 
  includes mobile and desktop designs to show how the website should look at different 
  screen sizes. Creating these projects has helped me refine my workflow and solve 
  real-world coding problems. I’ve learned something new with each project, helping 
  me to improve and adapt my style.
